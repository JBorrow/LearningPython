An Introduction to Programming With Python
==========================================

This is a project where we will write a 'book' that will accompany our course in
Python for Cafe Scientifique Durham City.

The project is written in a modular fashion, with each section in a different
.tex file. This allows us to change each section in an easy way without having
to mess around with huge plaintext files.

As such, it's actually also an introduction to writing modular LaTeX documents -
if you use the files as a guide!
